<p>Welcome to my page! 
</br>
I am Vikash Kodati, born in India and now living in Seattle, WA. I am an engineer/architect by heart and humanitarian by birth.
 As an angel investor, I focus on emerging tech AI and space startups, fostering growth and development in cutting-edge fields. In my role as Treasurer of the IITGAA, I am actively involved in alumni relations and community engagement, strengthening the bonds within our network. A space enthusiast and humanitarian, I balance a demanding career with family life, constantly seeking self-discovery, self-sufficiency, and peace. Living in the Pacific Northwest, I am an avid lover of its natural resources and enjoy exploring Pacific Northwest's stunning beauty.
